# Self-Consistent Schrödinger-Poisson Solver for Double-Gate MOSFETs

This project implements a **self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson solver** to analyze the electrical properties of a **Double-Gate MOSFET**. The solver allows investigation of:

- **Potential profile** across the device  
- **Electric field distribution**  
- **Energy band profile**  
- **Charge density profile**
- **C-V Characteristic**

For a detailed explanation of the methodology, results, and analysis, please refer to the project report:
